# Smart Mirror
The Raspberry Pi smart mirror is a digital mirror that that projects a computer display over a traditional reflective mirror. Some possible uses include displaying the time, a calendar, weather forecasts, or other applications in your reflection.

# Final Milestone
The third milestone, which involved working on the project's hardware component, constructing the mirror's frame, and assembling all of the parts, is now complete. I had to become familiar with tools that I had never used before in order to reach this milestone. I assembled my frame using a drill and a handsaw. Working with and learning how to use these tools was enjoyable. Accurately gauging the wood was where I had the most trouble. I built a frame, but the measurements were wrong, so I had to throw it away and start over.

# Second Milestone
My code was modified as part of my second milestone. I also included a Spotify module and a remote control module in addition to the weather, time, and news. The Spotify module displays your current Spotify listening activity. Additionally, you can operate the mirror with your phone by using the remote control module. I liked having a say in what modules I wanted to add to the mirror for this milestone. But I had a lot of trouble getting the modules to operate. I was unable to use a large number of modules since they were either out of date or incompatible with my code.

# First Milestone 
My first accomplishment was coding the code for my Raspberry Pi's digital display. I started by assembling and connecting the Raspberry Pi to my monitor along with all the other required parts. I then started to write the code. I had to install packages first on the terminal before I could edit the modules in my display. The informational items that are displayed are known as modules. I have the time, date, weather, current headlines, and compliments shown on my mirror. The first milestone was quite flexible, and I was able to alter my modules to fit my needs, thus I enjoyed working on it. Debugging that code took a lot of time because I was unable to get my weather module to accurately display the prediction. I finally realized it was a syntactic mistake.

# Starter Project
The adaptable Arduino project served as my first project. I chose a PIR motion sensor as the input, and an LED as the output. PIR motion sensors use two sensors to find heat energy in the surrounding area. The sensors activate and pick up motion when the signal between the two sensors shifts. I started my endeavor by creating the program's software. I attached the motion sensor to my Arduino after writing the motion sensor's code. After that, I included the LEDs in my project. I was able to get my LED to turn on when the sensor detected motion by doing this. Finally, I soldered everything together before reassembling my completed project.
