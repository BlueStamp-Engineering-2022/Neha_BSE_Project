# Smart Mirror
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was adding modifications to my code. Along with the weather, time, and news, I added a Spotify module and a remote control module. The Spotify module shows what you are currently listening to on Spotify. And the remote control module allows you to control the mirror from your phone. For this milestone, I enjoyed being able to choose what modules I wanted to add to the mirror. However, I had a lot of issues with getting modules to work. There were a lot of modules that I was not able to use because they were either too outdated or were not compatible with my code.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was writing the code for the digital display on my Raspberry Pi. I began by setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my monitor. Then, I began writing the code. First, I worked on the terminal to install packages and then I was able to edit the modules in my display. The modules are the pieces of information that are being displayed. For my mirror, I used date, time, weather, daily headlines, and compliments. I enjoyed working on the first milestone because it was ver customizable and I was able to edit my modules based on what I wanted. However, I was not able to get my weather module to display the forecast correctly so I had to spend a long time debugging that code. Eventually, I figured out that it was a syntax error.

# Starter Project
  

My starter project was the customizable Arduino project. For the inputs, I picked a PIR motion sensor and for the output, I used an LED. PIR motion sensors use a pair of sensors to detect heat energy in an environment. When the signal between the two sensors changes, the sensors engage and detect motion. I began my project by writing the software for my program. First, I wrote the code for the motion sensor and then I connected it to my Arduino. Then I integrated the LEDs into my project. By doing this, I was able to get my LED to light up when motion was sensed by the sensor. Lastly, I soldered everything together and then I put my final project back together.
