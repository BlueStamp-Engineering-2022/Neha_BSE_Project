# Smart Mirror
The Raspberry Pi smart mirror is a digital mirror that that projects a computer display over a traditional reflective mirror. Some possible uses include displaying the time, a calendar, weather forecasts, or other applications in your reflection.

# Final Milestone
I have completed the third milestone, which consisted of working on the hardware portion of the project, building the frame of the mirror, and putting all of the components together. Here is the completed mirror. For this milestone, I had to familiarize myself with tools that I had never worked with. I used a handsaw and a drill to put my frame together. I enjoyed working with and learning how to use these tools. My biggest struggle was measuring the wood accurately. I constructed a frame, but the measurements were off, so I had to scrap it and make a new frame again.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was adding modifications to my code. Along with the weather, time, and news, I added a Spotify module and a remote control module. The Spotify module shows what you are currently listening to on Spotify. And the remote control module allows you to control the mirror from your phone. For this milestone, I enjoyed being able to choose what modules I wanted to add to the mirror. However, I had a lot of issues with getting the modules to work. There were a lot of modules that I was not able to use because they were either too outdated or were not compatible with my code.

# First Milestone 
My first milestone was writing the code for the digital display on my Raspberry Pi. I began by setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my monitor. Then, I began writing the code. First, I worked on the terminal to install packages, and then I was able to edit the modules in my display. The modules are the pieces of information that are being displayed. For my mirror, I have the date, time, weather, daily headlines, and compliments displayed. I enjoyed working on the first milestone because it was very customizable and I was able to edit my modules based on what I wanted. However, I was not able to get my weather module to display the forecast correctly so I had to spend a long time debugging that code. Eventually, I figured out that it was a syntax error.

# Starter Project
My starter project was the customizable Arduino project. For the inputs, I picked a PIR motion sensor, and for the output, I used an LED. PIR motion sensors use a pair of sensors to detect heat energy in an environment. When the signal between the two sensors changes, the sensors engage and detect motion. I began my project by writing the software for my program. First, I wrote the code for the motion sensor and then I connected it to my Arduino. Then I integrated the LEDs into my project. By doing this, I was able to get my LED to light up when motion was sensed by the sensor. Lastly, I soldered everything together and then I put my final project back together.
